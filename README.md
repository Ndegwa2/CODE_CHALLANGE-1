CODE_CHALLANGE WEEK 1

DESCRIPTION.
The file comtains three projects linked by one index file with a nav bar to navigate through the entire challange.

1: SPEED _ DETECTOR.
employed the use of a simple interface and a javascript file.
In this one I used a prompt as oppossed to the general UI from html.
This was just in the spirits of exploration and more practice on code.
The program accepts integer iput from the user and returns feedback based on the value input.


2: STUDENT_GRADE_GENERATOR.

For this one I also used the prompt way.
It accepts integers as student marks and generally returns the value of their grade.
The input is limited for integers between 1-100.
Has a simple index.html file for UGI purposes only.


3: NET_SALARY_CALCULATOR.

In this partic;ar challange, I used the conventional way of the user and sysem interaction.
In the html doc, a user input their salary and the website returns all the deductions made.
It has a very simple UI that just displays the resultd after input of the basic salary.
